<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi — I’m Sihle, a third-year IT student (Diploma in PC Support & Networking) and an aspiring full-stack web developer currently completing the Full-Stack Web Developer course on Udemy. <br> My startup journey in the IT space began with a simple curiosity about how technology can solve real problems, and has grown into a practice of building practical, client-focused web solutions. <br> I translate business goals into clean, maintainable web applications by combining user-centred design, pragmatic engineering, and clear communication. I learn by shipping: every project sharpens my skills and improves the solutions I deliver, and I’m eager to collaborate with businesses and teams who want thoughtful, reliable digital products that drive real results.

    When I look back, my journey has always been about connecting curiosity with purpose. Starting in IT gave me the technical foundation, but it was when I began exploring startups and web development that I realized how powerful tech can be in solving real-world problems. <br> I’ve been driven by the idea of creating solutions that uplift people and communities. Learning full-stack web development on Udemy while studying IT in college has become more than just a skill-building process — it’s the groundwork for turning ideas into reality. <br> For me, coding isn’t just about writing lines of code, it’s about building something meaningful that reflects both creativity and impact.
